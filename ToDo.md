## To do

* Don't call setTimeout when a player matches a pair - waiting, only to continue play is tiresome.
* Remove seeks by players when they start a game.
* Give that alert div a fixed height.
* Acknowledge when a game is over - who's the winner.
* Make the ui nicer - a tacky card table look perhaps?
* Round cards, bigger, transform when the card is turned.
* Whose turn is it.
