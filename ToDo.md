## To do

* Remove seeks by players when they start a game.
* Acknowledge when a game is over - who's the winner.
* Make the ui nicer - a tacky card table look perhaps?
* Round cards, bigger, transform when the card is turned.
* Whose turn is it.
* Prevent a player from accepting their own seeks (change all those HttpStatus.OK responses in circumstances like this).
* Make the alert timeout cancellable.
